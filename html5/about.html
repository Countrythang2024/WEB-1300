        <h2>welcome to the world of opening a pet store</h2>
       <p>Opening a pet store takes a lot of work, but there's more that goes into a pet store then just starting the pet store. you also have to think about the many things that make a pet store a pet store; like the pet supplies, the pets running around and having fun, the openness that a pet has to play, an area that is safe for them, a family oriented place to where family can come hang out and just chill with their pets while they're looking for their pet supplies, a place where they can come and get anything that they may need, the friendships and the family that you'll create within a pet store from the returning customers. all kinds of pets will be coming in and out big, small, dogs, cats, you might even get some birds. There's so much more that comes into creating a pet store and those things are what makes a pet store so special.</p>
