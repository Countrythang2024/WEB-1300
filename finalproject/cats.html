                <h3>cats or dogs</h3>
                <p>Cats are normally smaller in size than dogs. Cats are cleaner and easier to take care of just because cats can normally keep themselves pretty clean. they also use the litter box and they'll cover up after they use the restroom because they're very shy independent individuals. Dogs on the other hand are messier and need a lot more attention than a cat would. dogs are very very needy and will use the restroom anywhere they see a spot to use the restroom so you'll be constantly walking and taking care of your dog. when your cat will normally let themselves out, walk themselves, and let themselves back in. cats are pretty good for that.</p>
